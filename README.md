### 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend     | SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, Chart.js                 |
| Backend      | LangGraph or LangChain, FastAPI (opt.)           |
| LLMs         | GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 (multi-agent blend) |
| Data Parsing | Papaparse.js / Python CSV module                 |
| Deployment   | Vercel, Netlify, or your custom edge CDN         |

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload CSV** – Drag & drop your dataset into the dashboard
2. **Agent Pipeline** – LLMs clean, analyze, infer schema, suggest charts
3. **Insight Generation** – Key takeaways written in human-friendly language
4. **UI Assembly** – Svelte components are generated and rendered live
5. **Export / Share** – Download full dashboard or embed in your site

### 🔮 Example Agents

| Name                | Task                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🧹 DataCleanerAgent | Fixes nulls, bad formats               |
| 🧠 SchemaAgent      | Classifies columns, detects categories |
| 📊 ChartAgent       | Recommends optimal chart type          |
| 📜 InsightAgent     | Writes a summary of insights           |
| 🧩 CodeAgent        | Generates Svelte chart components      |

### 🧪 Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/insightgrid
cd insightgrid
npm install
npm dev
```

You'll need to add an `.env` with your OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini API keys.
Use a backend (optional) to manage file uploads + agent logic if going full LangChain.

### 🧃 Future Ideas

- Voice interface: "Hey InsightGrid, show me user churn from Jan to May!"
- Fine-tuned agents: Use RAG to build domain-specific analysts
- Timeline builder: Animated data story over time
- PDF export: Report-style dashboard outputs for stakeholders
